- What is MyDevices ?

MyDevices is an Indivo PHA project that delivers a Continua WAN Interface Receiver module(Continua Design Guidelines 2010) for Indivo X : It receives securely observations from many Medical Devices (Blood pressure, Weight scale, Thermometer…) and stores them in Indivo using SNOMED CT and UCUM nomenclatures. It enables end-to-end connected health solutions based on the Continua architecture and Indivo.

Please note:
1) As the project is still ongoing, the application is not yet certified by the Continua Health Alliance, so Continua conformity can’t apply.
2) The trusted service (WS-Security profile) required by the Continua Design Guidelines 2010 is not provided in this distribution. You can contact us if you would like more information about it.
