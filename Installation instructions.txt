                             MyDevices
                    A Continua interface for Indivo X

MyDevices is an Indivo X PHA project that delivers a Continua WAN Interface Receiver Open Source module for Indivo X: It receives securely observations from many Medical Devices (Blood pressure, Weight scale, Thermometer…) and stores them in Indivo using SNOMED CT and UCUM nomenclatures. It will enable end-to-end connected health solutions based on the Continua architecture and Indivo X. 

Please note that, as the project is still ongoing, the application is not yet certified by the Continua Health Alliance, so Continua conformity can’t apply.

France Telecom Orange is a promoter member of the Continua Health Alliance (http://www.continuaalliance.org/about-the-alliance/member-companies.html).

This document describes how to install and configure MyDevices for Indivo X.

Before starting
---------------

MyDevices is a Java Web Application that uses Metro framework. Please install on your server Java EE 6 SDK & GlassFish Server Open Source Edition 3.1 (or higher) (http://glassfish.java.net); 
or install Metro 2.1 with your preferred servlet/jsp container.

The following instructions assume that you have already installed and operated Indivo X; 
if not please first refer to the Indivo X Wiki (http://wiki.chip.org/indivo/index.php/Indivo).

1 Installation
--------------

MyDevices is made of two web application archives, MyDevices.war and ContinuaConnector.war, located in the dist\war directory:
- MyDevices.war provides the frameable Indivo GUI in order to authorize and add the Continua connectivity to the record.
- ContinuaConnector.war provides the technical interface to receive and store in a record measurements taken by a Continua device. 


1.1 Database
(PgAdmin is your friend - http://www.pgadmin.org -)

* On the PostgreSql Server, create a database named "mydevices" 
* Set the Indivo user ("indivo" by default) as owner of the database or create a new user.
* Add the following table to the database: 

CREATE TABLE credentials (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
accessKey VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
controlKey VARCHAR(100),
indivo_token VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
indivo_tokenSecret VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, 
indivo_recordId VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL);


1.2 Web Application archives

* Deploy both war provided in the dist\war directory.

For Glassfish users, use the Glassfish administration console, http://your.server:4848. 
	->  Select "Applications" and click on the "Deploy" button. 
	->  Select the war you want to deploy. 
	->  Uncheck the "enabled" checkbox of "status" item. (you have to update config files before running it).
	->  Click on "OK".

* Update the config.properties files in MyDevices\WEB-INF\classes and ContinuaConnector\WEB-INF\classes with your Indivo X and PostgreSQL addresses and credentials. 

For Glassfish users, you will find the deployed archives in glassfish_install_directory\glassfish\domains\domain_name\applications.

PHA_CONSUMER_KEY	indivo consumer_key	-> Refer to your Indivo PHA config
PHA_CONSUMER_SECRET     indivo secret		-> Refer to your Indivo PHA config
PHA_APP_ID		indivo app id		-> Refer to your Indivo PHA config
INDIVO_SERVER_URL       indivo server 		-> the Indivo server
INDIVO_UI_SERVER_URL    indivo ui server	-> the Indivo UI server
DB_DRIVER 		org.postgresql.Driver   
DB_USER                 PostgreSql user		-> Refer to 1.1
DB_PASSWORD             PostgreSql password	-> Refer to 1.1
DB_URL                  Postgresql database     -> Refer to 1.1 

* Start or restart the applications.

For Glassfish users, enable your application with the Admin console: select "Applications", check your application in the list and click on the "Enable" button.

* Check that the applications are running with a web browser:

http://your.server:8080/MyDevices/
http://your.server:8080/continuaConnector/DeviceObservationConsumer_Service?wsdl



2 Indivo X setup
----------------

* You need to register MyDevices on Indivo X. Here is a sample of user_app element to add to indivo_data.xml file (on Indivo server). Update "your.server" to your server alias or IP. 

<user_app name='My Devices' email='mydevices@apps.indivo.org'>
      <description>Add Continua connectivity to your record.</description>
      <consumer_key>mydevices</consumer_key>
      <secret>mysecret</secret>
      <frameable>True</frameable>
      <has_ui>True</has_ui>
      <start_url_template>
	http://your.server:8080/MyDevices/start_auth?record_id={record_id}&#38;carenet_id={carenet_id}&#38;document_id={document_id}
      </start_url_template>
      <callback_url>
        http://your.server:8080/MyDevices/after_auth
      </callback_url>
 </user_app>

* Copy my_devices.png in indivo_ui_server/ui/jmvc/ui/resources/images/app_icons_32. The file is located in the dist\indivo directory.
